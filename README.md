## Java Design Patterns Examples

### The Observer Pattern 
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one 
object changes state, all its dependents are notified 
and updated automaticaly.

### The Decorator Pattern 
Attaches additional responsibilities to an 
object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to
subclassing for extending functionality.
